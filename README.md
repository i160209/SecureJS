## Secure JS

Final Year Project (FAST NUCES)

Problem Domain:

One of the greatest concerns in today's word is the security issues of code that make the web applications vulnerable to exploits. These exploits can severely damage the normal workflow of an application or can lead to theft of data which may be considered as the most valuable entity.
Most of the website and web-applications use JavaScript as a scripting language which has a lot of open-source libraries available over the internet. These JavaScript libraries may have security flaws that can make the website which is using it "vulnerable". A piece of code is considered vulnerable if it generates unwanted effects for the user.
Vulnerable JavaScript code available on web pages is becoming a rising security issue because of the possibility of having a severe impact on its exploit. Due to the increasing complexity and obfuscation of the code, detecting the vulnerabilities is now becoming a difficult goal to achieve.
